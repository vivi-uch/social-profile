## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

```html
<!-- font awesome, useful for adding icons and many more to your erbsite -->

<!-- a script tag must be embedded in the the head section to allow the icons or whatever show -->

<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/dcb37cc1ad.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

```
```css
/* learnt about hover and focus */
a:hover{
    color: #000;
    font-size: bold;
}
button:focus{
    background-color: blue;
}
button:hover{
    background-color: rgb(86, 109, 52);
}
```

### Continued development

In later projects i want to have a better understanding on positions in CSS
